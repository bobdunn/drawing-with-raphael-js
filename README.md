# drawing-with-raphael-js
This repo is some experiments I've been doing with raphael.js.

I've put some work into drawing mandalas. I've detailed it in [this](./mandala.md) readme, and you can see it [here](./public/manala.html).

I've also made a fun animated random drawing widget that you can see [here](./public/draw.html).
